Function  call  (or)  Invoking  the  function
------------------------------------------------
1) How  is  a  function  called ?  --->  functioname(arguments)  (or)  functionname()

2) What  is  a  function  call ?  ---> Branching

3) What  is  branching  ? --->  Control  branches  to  the  called  function , executes  the  function             
					       and  returns  to  calling  code  soon  after  called  function  terminates

4) When  are  the  statements  in  the  function  executed  ?  --->  As  soon  as  function  is  called

5) Is  function  executed  on  its  own ?  --->  No

*6) In  other  words,  function  is  not  executed  unless  it  is  called

7) Therefore  every  function  needs  a  call

8) Can  a  function  be  called  before  it  is  defined ?  --->  No

9) In  other  words,  define  the  function  first  and  then  call  the  function

10) Arguments  (or)  parameters  in  the  function  call  are  passed  to  the  function
      i.e.  Actual  parameters  are  copied  to  formal  parameters
