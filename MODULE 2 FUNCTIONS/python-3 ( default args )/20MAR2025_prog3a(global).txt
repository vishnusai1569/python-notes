global  keyword
-------------------
1) def  f1():
	  x = 10
    What  does  x = 10  do  ?  ---> Creates  a  LV  with  value  10

2) How  to  prevent  a  function  in  creating  a  Lv ?  --->  With  global  keyword

3) def  f1():
          global  x
	  x = 10
    What  does  x = 10  do  ?  ---> Creates  a  GV  with  value  10

4) What  does  global  x  do ?  ---> Informs  function  to  treat  variable  'x'  as  global

5) In  other  words,  global  keyword  prevents  function  to  create  (or)  have  a   LV  

6) Can  global  keyword  be  used  without  a  GV  ?  --->  Yes

7) x = 10
    def  f1():
          global  x
	  x = 20
    What  does  x = 20  do  ?  ---> Modifies  value  of  GV  to  20

8) def  f1():
          x = 10
          global  x
    Is  global  x  valid ?  --->  No  becoz  there  is  already  a  Lv  'x'  in  f1()  function 

9) In  other  words,  funtion  can  not  have  local  variable  to  use   global  keyword 

10) def  f1():
             pass
      global   x
      Can  global  keyword  be  used  outside  the  function ?  ---> 						
							Yes  but  it  is  of  no  use  becoz  local  variables  do  not  exist  outside  the  function

11) def  f1():
           global  x  = 10
     Is  the  above  statement  valid ?  ---> No  becoz  initialization  is  not  permitted  in   global  keyword  as  variable  is  not  created
