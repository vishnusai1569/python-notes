nonlocal  keyword
--------------------
1) def  f1():
         def  f2():
	        x = 10
    What  does  x = 10  do  ?  ---> Creates  a  LV  in  inner  function  with  value  10

2) How  to  prevent  inner  function  in  creating  a  Lv ?  --->  With  nonlocal  keyword

3) def  f1():
          x = 10
          def   f2():
               nonlocal  x
	       x = 20
    What  does  x = 20  do  ?  --->  Modifies  value  of  LV  of  outer  function  to  20

4) What  does  nonlocal  x  do ?  ---> Informs  inner  function  to  treat  variable  'x'  as  Lv  of  outer  function

5) In  other  words,  nonlocal  keyword  prevents  inner  function  to  create  (or)  have  a   LV  

6) def  f1():
	  def  f2():
	       nonlocal  x
    In  nonlocal  x  valid  in  f2()  function ?  --->  No  becoz  there  is  no  local  variable  'x'  in  outer  function  f1
						
7) In  other  words,  pre-requisite  to  use  nonlocal  keyword  is  that  there  should  be  a  LV  in
    outer()  function  with  same  name  

8) def  f1():
          x = 10
         def  f2():
               x = 20
               nonlocal  x
    Is  nonlocal  x  valid ?  --->  No  becoz  there  is  already  a  Lv  'x'  in   inner  function  f2

9) In  other  words,  inner  funtion  can  not  have  a  local  variable  to  use  nonlocal  keyword 

10) def  f1():
             nonlocal   x
      Is  the  above  nonlocal  valid  ?  --->  No  becoz  nonlocal  keyword  can  not  be  used  in  outer  function 
            
11) In  other  words,  nonlocal  keyword   can  be  used  only  in  inner  function
