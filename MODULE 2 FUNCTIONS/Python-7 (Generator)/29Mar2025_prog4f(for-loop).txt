for  loop
----------
1) for  x   in   generator-object:
          pass

2) What  does  first  iteration  of  for  loop  do  ?  ---> 			 								
								Executes  generator  function  from  the  begining  till  first  yield  statement
								and  the  object  which  is   yielded  is  returned  to  for  loop  variable  'x'

3) What  about  ramining  iterations  of  for  loop  ? --->  																
					Resumes  generator  function  execution  from  where  function  got  paused  till 
				        next  yield  statement  and  the  object  which  is   yielded  is  returned  to  for  loop  variable  'x'

4) for  x   in   generator-object:
           pass
    What  is  the  value  of  'x' ?  ---> The  element  yielded  by  generator  function  (or)  expression

5) How  long  is  for  loop  executed  ?  --->  Until  StopIteation  error  is   thrown

6) What  is  the  advantage  of  for  loop  ?  --->  It  internally  handles  StopIteration  error  and 
									     hence  it  need  not  be  handled  explicitly 

7) When  is  for  loop  terminated ?  --->  As  soon  as  StopIteration  is  raised
