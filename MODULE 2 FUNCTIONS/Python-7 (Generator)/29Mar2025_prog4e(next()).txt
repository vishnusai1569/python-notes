What  are  the  two  ways  to  iterate  a   generator ?  --->  With  next()  function  and  for  loop

next()  function
-------------------
1) What  is  the  syntax  of  next()  function ?  ---> next(generator  object)

2) What  is  the  result  of  next(g) ?  --->  That  object  yielded  by  generator  function  or  expression

3) What  does  first  call  to  next(g)  do ?  --->  
									Executes  generator  function  from  the  begining  till  first  yield  statement
							                and  the  object  is  yielded  to  next(g)

4) What  about  subsequent  calls  to  next(g)  do ?  ---> 							
								Resumes  generator  function  execution  from  where  function  got  paused ,   
						                continues  till  next  yield  statement  and  the  object  is  yielded  to  next(g)

5) Where  is  next()  function  used (inside  (or)  outside  the  loop) ?  --->																											
											Inside  the  loop  to  obtain  each  element  of  generator

6) What  does  next(g)  do  when  generator  got  exhausted ?  --->  Throws  StopIteration   error

7) Is  next(sequence)  valid ?  --->  No  and  argument  should  be  generator 
    Is  next(non-sequence)  valid ?  --->  No
