yield  statement
--------------------
1) What  is  the  syntax  of  yield  ?  --->  Yield  any-python-object 

2) What  does  yield  object  do ?  --->  Returns  object  to  next(g)  (or)  for  loop  variable (may  be  'x')
												and
							      remembers  the  state  in  view  of  next  call  to  next(g)

3) What  does  yield  25  do  ?  --->  Returns  25  to  next(g)  (or)  for  loop  variable 
									and
							 remembers  the  state

4) When  are  the  statements  following  yield  executed ?  --->  When  generator  resumes  execution  again
												       i.e.  next(g)   (or)  in   next  iteration  of  for  loop

5) yield  is  used  when  we  want  to  iterate  over  a  sequence  of  values  but  don’t  
    want  to  store  the  entire  sequence  in  memory

6) How  is  yield  different  from  return  statement ?  --->  yield  remembers  the  state  but  not  return  statement

7) What  does  return  object  do ?  --->  Returns  object  to  function  call  and
								 rest  of  the  function  is  never  executed
