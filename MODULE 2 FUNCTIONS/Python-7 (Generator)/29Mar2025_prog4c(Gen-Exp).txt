1) What  is  another  way  to  define  a  generator ?  --->  With  generator  expression

2) How  to  define  a  generator  expression ?  --->  (expression  for  loop)

3) g = (x * x   for   x    in  range(5)) 
    What  is  the  above  expression  called ? --->  Generator  expression  but  not  tuple  comprehension

4) g = (x * x   for   x    in  range(5)) 
    What  does  the  above  statement  do ?  --->  
							Creates  an  empty  generator  object  but  does  execute  generator  expression  

5) Why  are  0 ^ 2 , 1 ^ 2 , 2 ^ 2 , 3 ^ 2 , 4 ^ 2  not  stored  in  generator  ?  ---> Since  elements  are  yielded  on  demand  but  not  in  advance
