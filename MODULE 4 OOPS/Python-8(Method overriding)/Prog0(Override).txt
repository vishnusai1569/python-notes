Method  Overriding
-----------------------
1) class  parent:
	   def  m1(self):
	         idly
    class  child(parent):
           def   m1(self):
		 puri

2) What  is  method  overriding ? --->  Modification  of  parent  class  method  in  child  class

3) In  other  words,  defining  same  method  in  child  class  with  a  different  task  is  called   method  overriding

4) parent  class  method  does  an  operation(may  be  addition)   and
    same  method  in  child  class  does  a  different  operation(may  be  subtraction).
    This  is  called  method  overriding  which  is  nothing  but  polymorphism  i.e. many  forms

5) Finally  same  method  behaves  differently  in  parent  and  child  classes

6) What  is  parent  method  called ?  --->  Overridden  method
    What  is  child  method  called ?  ---> Overriding  method

7) What  is  the  reason  to  override  a  method ?  --->  Since we  are  not  happy  with  parent  class  method,
										        modify  the  method  in  child  class

8) When  is  a  method  not  inherited  to  child  class ?  --->  When  it  is  overridden  by  the  child  class
    When  is  a  method  inherited  to  child  class ?  ---> When  it  is  not  overridden  by  child  class

9) What  is  the  advantage  of  method  overriding ?  --->
					Both  parent  class  method  and  child  class  method  are  executed   by  same  call

10) Which  method  is  executed  for  x . m1() ?  --->  parent  method  is  executed  if  'x'  is   parent  object  and
										    child  method  is  executed  if  'x'  is   child  object
