Multiple  inheritance
------------------------
1) class  c1:
           methods
    class  c2:
	   methods
    class  c3:
	   methods
    class  c4(c2 , c1 , c3):
	   methods

2) What  is  multiple  inheritance ?  --->  A  class  is  derived  from  multiple  classes

3) In  otherwords,  if  there  is  more  than  one  parent  class,   it  is  known  as  multiple  inheritance

4) From  how  many  classes  is  class  c4  derived  ? --->  Three  classes
											  i.e. c1 , c2  and  c3

5) What  is  in  class  c4  finally ?  --->  All  the  members  of  classes  c1 , c2 , c3  and  new  members

6) In  other  words,  members  of  classes  c1 , c2 , c3  are  inherited  to  c4

7) What  is  super()  wrt  class  c4 ?  --->  c2  becoz  c4  is  derived  from  c2  first

8) Classes  derivation  order  matters  but  not  definitions  order
