Advantagess  of  inheritance
----------------------------------
1) Code  Reusability

2) Time  and  money  are  saved

3) Extensibility

4) Reliability

5) Method  Overriding

Code  Reusability
--------------------
1) Parent  class  code(i.e. methods)  can  be  reused  by  child  class

2) Hence  do  not  rewrite  parent  class  code  in  child  class

3) Reuse  the  code  but  do  not  rewrite

4) Child  class  get()  method  calls  parent  class  get()  method  in  order  to  read  new  instance  variables

5) Similarly  child  class  disp()  method  calls   parent  class  disp()  method  to  print  new  instance  variables

6) class   parent:
	   def  m1(self):
	          100  statements
    class  child(parent):
    	   def  m1(self):
	          super() . m1()
		  50  statements

Time  and  money  are  saved
----------------------------------
1) Due  to  reusability  of  code,  time  and  money  are  saved

2) Do  not  start  from  scratch  while  designing  child  class

3) Child  class  design  starts  from  that  stage  where  parent  class  is  left  and
    then  new  features  are  added  to  child  class

4) Python  3.13  design  starts  from  where  python  3.12  is  left  and
    then  new  features  are  added  to  python  3.13

5) Windows  11  design  starts  from  where  windows  10  is  left

Extensibility
--------------
1) class  c1:
             3  static  variables  and  4  methods
    class  c2(c1):
            5  static  variables  and  6  methods

2) class  c2  is  an  extension  of  class  c1

3) class  c2  has  all  the  features  of  class  c1  and  new  features

4) class  c2  has  3 + 5 = 8  variables  and  4 + 6 = 10  methods

*5) In  other  words,  a  class  can  be  extended  with  inheritance

6) Python  3.13  is  an  extension  of  python  3.12  and
    Windows  11   is  an  extension  of  windows  10

7) a = c1()
    b = c2()
    What  is  the  type  of  object  'b' ?  --->   c2  and  c1  becoz  c2  is  an  extension  of  c1
    What  is  the  type  of  object  'a' ?  --->  Only  c1

Reliability
------------
1) We  can  rely  on  parent  class  while  designing  child  class  becoz  parent  class  is  an  existing  class

2) Child  class  methods  need  to  be  tested  for  their  functionality  becoz  they  are  newly  added  to  the  class

3) But  parent  class  methods  need  not  be  tested   becoz  it  is  an  existing  class

Method  Overriding
-----------------------
1) If  we  are  not  happy  with  any  parent  class  method,  it  can  be  modified  by  child  class

2) This  modification  is  called  method  overriding

3) In  otherwords,  designing  same  method  in  child  class  with  a  different  code  is  called  method  overriding

Note:
1) What  is  decorator ?  --->  Modification  of  function
                                               i.e.  Adding  new  features  to  a  function  without  explicitly  modifying  the  function

2) What  is  inheritance ?  --->  Modification  of  class
                                                  i.e.  Adding  new  features  to  a  class  without  explicitly  modifying  the  class

3) What  is  method  overriding ?  --->  Modification  of  method
                                                              i.e.  Adding  new  features  to  a  method  without  explicitly  modifying  the  method

Disadvantages  of  inheritance
------------------------------------
1) Execution  is  slow  due  to  redirection
    Eg: c = child()
          c . m1() --->  m1  method  is  searched  in  child  class   and  if  not  found  in  child  class,
			      m1  is  searched  in  parent  class.
	                      Therefore  m1()  method  is  searched  in  two  classes  and  execution  becomes  slow

2) Improper  use  of  inheritance  may  lead  to  wrong  solutions

3) Often, parent  class  methods  are  left  unused  by  child  class,   which  leads  to  memory  wastage.
    Eg : If  parent  class  has  10  methods  but  child  class  uses  only  6  methods,
           remaining  4  methods  are  left  unused  which  leads  to  memory  wastage

4) Parent  and  child  classes  are  tightly  coupled
    i.e.  They  are  dependent  on  each  other.
    Any  small  change  in  parent  class  will  affect  all  the  child  classes.
    Eg: If  parent  class  method  name  m1  is  modified  to  m2 ,  modify  the  method  call   in  child  class
          i.e. super() . m1()  should  be  modified  to  super() . m2()
