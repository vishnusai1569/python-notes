Inheritance
--------------
1) What  is  inheritance ?  --->  A  class  is  acquiring  properties  of  another  class

2) What  are  the   properties  of  a  class ?   --->  Static  variables  and  methods

3) class  c2(c1):
             pass
    class  c2  is  derived  from  class  c1

4) What  are  inherited  from  class  c1  to  c2 ?  --->  Both  static  variables  and  methods

5) In  other  words,  every  member  of  class  c1  is  inherited  to  c2

6) What  is  in  class  c2  on  the  whole ?  --->  All  the  members  of  class  c1  and  new  members  of  class  c2

7) In  other  words,  class  c2  has  all  the  features  of  class  c1  and  new  features

8) Is  class  c2  a  brand  new  class ?  --->  No  and  it  is  an  extension  of  class  c1

9) What  is  class  c1  called ?  ---> Parent  class , super  class , base  class  (or) old  class
    What  is  class  c2  called ?  ---> Child  class , sub  class , derived  class  (or) new  class

10) When  is  inheritance  recommended  ?  --->
							To  add  new  features  to  an  existing  class  without  explicitly  modifying  the  class

11) In  other  words,  a  class  can  be  enhanced  with  inheritance

12) class  c1:
             3  static  variables  and  4  methods
     class   c2(c1):
              5  static  variables  and  6  methods
    What  is  in  class  c2  on  the  whole  ?  ---> 3 + 5 = 8  static  variables  and  4 + 6 = 10  methods

13) Is  parent  method  inherited  to  child  class  when  same  method  exists  in  child  class ?  --->
													No  becoz  the  method  is  already  in  child  class

14) When  is  a  method  inherited  to  child  class ?  --->  When  same  method  is  not  in  child  class

15) Let  parent  class  have  m1()  method  and  child  class  have  m2()  method ,
      How  many  methods  are  in  child  class  on  the  whole ? --->  1 + 1 = 2  methods
                                                                                                        i.e.  m1()  and  m2()

16) Let  parent  class  have  m1()  method  and  child  class  also  have  m1()  method ,
      How  many  methods  are  in  child  class  on  the  whole ? ---> Just  one

17) In  other  words,  parent  class  m1()  method  is  not  inherited  becoz  child  class  already  has  m1()  method

18) If  parent  class  and  child  class  have  members  with  same  name, how  are  they  distinguished ?  --->
														super() . member  and  self . member

19) What  is  the  difference  between  self  and  super()  ?  --->
									self  refers  to  same  class  and  super()  refers  to  parent  class

20) Which  methods  can  be  called  wrt  child  object ?  --->  Both  parent  and  child  methods
      Which  methods  can  be  called  wrt  parent  object ?  ---> Only  parent  methods

21) Let  parent  class  have  3  methods  and  child  class  have  5  methods,
      How  many  methods  can  be  called  wrt  child  object  ?  ---> 3 + 5 = 8 methods
      How  many  methods  can  be  called  wrt  parent  object  ?  ---> Three  methods

22) Which  class  is  the  parent  class  to  all  python  classes  ?  ---> object  class

23) class  c1(object):
                pass
      Is  object  mandatory  for  the  above  class ?  --->
								No  becoz  object  is  the  default  parent  class  to  every  python  class

24) Where  is  object  class  defined ?  ---> In  builtins  module

25) When  is  super()  not  required  to  access  parent  class  member  ?  --->
									When  there  is  no  member  with  same  name  in  child  class

26) Are  values  of  parent  object  copied  to  child  object  when  child  object  is  created  ?  --->
							No  becoz  inheritance  is  from  class  to  class   but  not  from  object  to  object

27) In  other  words , instance  variables  are  not  inherited
