Hierarchical  Inheritance
-----------------------------
1) class  c1:
	  def  m1(self):
	          pass
    class  c2(c1):
	  def  m2(self):
	          pass
    class  c3(c1):
	   def  m3(self):
	          pass
    class  c4(c1):
  	   def  m4(self):
	          pass

2) What  is  hierarchical  inheritance ? --->  Multiple  classes  are  derived  from  same  class

3) From  which  class  are  classes  c2 , c3  and  c4  derived  ? ---> Same  class   c1

4) In  otherwords,  if  there  is  more  than  one  child  class,  it  is  known  as  hierarchical  inheritance.

5) To  which  classes  are  members  of  class  c1  inherited  ?  --->  c2 , c3  and  c4

6) What  is  the  method  of  class  c1 ?  --->  m1()
    What  are  the  methods  of  class  c2 ?  ---> m1()  and  m2()
    What  are  the  methods  of  class  c3 ?  --->  m1()  and  m3()
    What  are  the  methods  of  class  c4 ?  --->  m1()  and  m4()

7) How  is  hierarchical  inheritance  different  from  multiple  inheritance  ?  --->
							    There  is  more  than  one  parent  class  in  multiple  inheritance  but
						             there  is  more  than  one  child  class  in  hierarchical  inheritance

8) In  other  words,  hierarchical  inheritance  is  quite  opposite  to  multiple  inheritance
