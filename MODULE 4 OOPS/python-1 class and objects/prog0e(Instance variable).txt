Instance  Variable
---------------------
1) What  is  an  instance  variable  ?  --->  A  variable  of  the  object
    What  is  a  local  variable  ?  --->  A  variable  of  the  function  (or)  method
    What  is  a  global  variable  ?  --->  A  variable  of  the  module  (or)  program

2) Where  is  instance  variable  represented ?  --->  Inside  the  object

3) Instance  variable  is  a  member  of  what ?  --->  Object

4) What  are  instance  variables  of  date  object ?  --->  dd , mm  and  yy
     What  are  instance  variables  of  rational  object ? --->  num  and  den
     What  are  instance  variables  of  time  object ?  ---> hours , minutes  and  seconds
     What  are  instance  variables  of  complex  object ?  --->   real  and  imag
     What  are  instance  variables  of  employee  object ?  ---> empnumber , empname , salary  and  so  on

5) How  to  add  an  instance  variable  to  an  object ?   --->  object . new-variable = value

6) Where  can  instance  variable  be  added  to  the  object ?  --->  Any  where  in  the  program

7) a = emp()   --->  Empty  object
    What  does  a . empno = 25  do ? ---> Adds  variable  empno  to  object  'a'  with  value  25
    What  does  a . empno = 35  do ? --->  Modifies  value  of  empno  in  object  'a'  to  35

8) object . new-variable = 25
    What  does  the  above  statement  do ?  ---> Adds  a  new  variable  to  the   object  with  value  25

9) object . existing-variable = 35
    What  does  the  above  statement  do ?  ---> Modifies  value  of  the  variable  to  35

10) How  to  delete  instance  variable  of  the  object ? --->  del   object . variable

11) What  does  del  a . empno  do ?  --->  Removes  variable  empno  from  object  'a'

12) del  object . valid-variable
     What  does  the  above  statement  do ?  --->  Removes  variable  from  the  object

13) del  object . invalid-variable
      What  does  the  above  statement  do ?  --->  Throws  AttributeError

14) Python  objects  are  growable  and  shrinkable
      i.e. New  variables  can  be  added  to  the  object  and  existing  variables  can  be  removed  from  the
      object  any  where  in  the  program

15) In  other  words,  python  objects  are  dynamic


Note:
What  about  java  and  c++  objects  ?  --->  They  are  neither  growable  nor  shrinkable
								       i.e.  static  objects
