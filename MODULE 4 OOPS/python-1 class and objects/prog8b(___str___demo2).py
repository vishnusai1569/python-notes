'''
1) Why  is  __str__()  method  of   object  class  executed ?  --->  Since  there  is  no  __str__()  method  in  Date  class

2) What  does  __str__()  method  of  object  class  do ?   --->  Returns  type  and  address  of  the  object

3) What  is  special  about  object  class ?  --->  It  is  the  parent  class  to  all  python  classes
