filter  iterator
-----------------
1) Is  filter  a  function  (or)  class ?  --->  Class  i.e.  Pre-defined  class

2) What  is  the  first  argument  of  filter  constructor ?  --->  Either  regular  function  (or)  lambda  function
    What  is  the  2nd   argument  of  filter  constructor ?  --->  Sequence  (or)  iterator

3) What  does  filter(function , sequence)  do ?  --->  Creates  an  empty  filter  object

4) How  many  arguments  can  regular  (or)  lambda  function  take ?  --->  Single  argument

5) What  is  the  value  of  argument ?  --->  Each  element  of  sequence  (or)  iterator

6) What  can  regular  (or)  lambda  function  return  ?  ---> True  or  False

7) When  is  regular  (or)  lambda  function  executed  ?  --->  For  next(filter  object)
													(or)
												 in  each  iteration  of  for  loop

8) What  happens  when  regular  (or)  lambda  function  returns  True ?  --->
						Returns  element  of  the  sequence  (or)  iterator  to  next(f)  (or)  for  loop  variable

9) What  happens  when  regular (or)  lambda  function  returns  False ?  --->
							Ignores  the  element  and  moves  to  next  element  of  sequence  (or)  iterator

10) In  other  words,  regular  (or)  lambda  function  is  executed  on  each  element  of  sequence  (or)  iterator

11) What  does  next(filter-object)  do ?  --->
						Yields   that  element  of  sequence (or)  iterator  which  satisfies  the  condition

12) What  is  the  use  of  filter  iterator ?  ---> Selects  few  elements  of  sequence (or)  iterator  and
									    discards   remaining  elements  based  on  condition

13) Where  is  filter  class  defined ?  --->  In  builtins  module
