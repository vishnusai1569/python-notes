Static  Variable
-------------------
1) What  is  a  static  variable ?  --->  A  variable  which  is  global  to  all  the  objects  of  same  class

2) In  other  words,  static  variable  is  not  represented  in  every  object (unlike  instance  variable)

3) Is  static  variable  a  member  of  the  object ?  --->   No  and  it  is  a  member  of  class  (Just  like  method)

4) Why  is  static  variable  not  a  member  of  the  object  ?  --->  Since  it  is  not  represented  inside  the  object

5) How  to  add  static  variable  to  a  class ?  --->   variable = value  inside  the  class(but  not  inside  the   method)

6) class   c1:
	  c1 . a = 10
    Is  classname  c1  mandatory  in  the  above  statement ?  --->  No  becoz  it  is  initialized  inside  the  class  c1

7) What  is  the  another  way  to  add  static  variable  to  a  class ?  --->  classname . variable = value  anywhere  in  the  program

8) class   c1:
	   def   m1(self):
		 c1 . x = 30
    Is  classname  c1  mandatory  in  the  above  statement ?  --->  Yes  and  'x'  becomes  a  local  variable  when  classname  c1  is  omitted

9) How  is  static  variable  accessed ?  --->  Thru  classname
                                                                      i.e.  classname . variable

10) How  to  access  static  variable  'x'  of  class  c1 ?  ---> c1 . x

11) When  is  static  variable  recommended  ?  --->  When  same  value  is  to  be  represented  in  every  object,
									  	   it  leads  to  data  redundancy(i.e. duplication).
										   Therefore  static  variable  is  used  as  an  alternative

12) Can  collegename  be  a  static  variable ?  --->  Yes  when  all  the  students  study  in  same  college

13) In  other  words,  collegename  is  represented  only  once  and  all  the  students  share  the  same  collegename

14) Can  rollnumber  be  a  static  variable ?  --->  No  becoz  each  student  has  got  a  different  roll  number

15) How  to  obtain  all  the  static   variables  of  a  class ?  --->  classname . __dict__

16) What  does  c1 .  __dict__  do ? --->  Returns  all  the  static  variables  of  class  c1  along  with  environment  variables
								 in  the  form  of  dictionary

17) object . static-variable
      Can  static  variable  be  accessed  wrt  object  ?  --->  Yes  but  not  recommended  becoz  it  is  global  to  all  the  objects
                                                                                            and  does  not  belong  to  any  one  particular  object

18) If  an  object  modifies  value  of  a  static  variable ,  are  changes  visible  to  remaining  objects ?  --->
																Yes  becoz  it  is  global  to  all  the  objects

19) What  are  the  four  advantages  of  static  variable ?  --->
      a) It  can   be  accessed  directly  without  an  object  as  it  is  accessed  through  classname
      b) No  data  redundancy
      c) Data  sharing  is  permitted
      d) No  memory  wastage

20) Can  instance  variable  be  accessed  without  an  object ?  --->
								No  and  object  is  mandatory  to  access  non-static  vaiable (i.e. Instance variable)

Note:
class   c1:
	a = 10
	def   m1(self):
		b = 20
		c1 . c = 30
		self . d = 40
e = 50
1) What  is  'a' ?  ---> static  variable  of  class  c1
2) What  is  'b' ?  --->  Local  variable  of  m1()  method  in  class  c1
3) What  is  'c' ?  --->  static  variable  of  class  c1
4) What  is  'd' ?  --->  Instance  variable
5) What  is  'e' ?  --->  Global  variable
