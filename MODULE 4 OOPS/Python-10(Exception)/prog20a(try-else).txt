try-else
----------
1) else:
            statements

2) When  is  else  suite  executed ?  --->  When  try  suite  does  not  raise  an  error

3) What  is  the  difference  between  except  and  else   suites ?  --->
					    except  suite  is  executed  only  when  try  suite  raises  an  error  and
					    else  suite  is  executed  when  try  suite  does  not  raise  any  error

4) In  other  words,  except  and  else  are  quite  opposite
    i.e.  Any  one  is  executed  but  not  both

5) Which  of  the  following  are  valid ?
     a) try - else - finally ?  --->  Invalid   becoz  else  suite  can  not  be  used  without  except  suite
     b) try - else - except -  finally ? --->  Invalid  becoz  else  suite  can  not  be  before  except  suite
    c) try - except - else - else - else  -  finally ? ---> Invalid   due  to  multiple  else  suites

6) What  is  the  location  of  else  suite ?  ---> Between  except  and  finally
                                                                           i.e.  try - except - else - finally

7) How  many  else  suites  are  permitted  for  a  try  suite ?  --->  Either  one  or  none  but  not  more  than  one


Note :
1) What  are  the  five  different  combinations  of  else ?  --->
									if - else , if - elif - else , for - else , while - else  and  try - except - else

2) if  cond:
         statements
    else:
	  statements
    When  is  else  suite  executed  wrt  if  ?  ---> When  the  if  condition  is  false

3) When  is  else  suite  executed  wrt  for  loop  and  while ?  --->
								After  the  loop  terminates  provided  loop  is  not  broken  in  the  middle

4) When  is  else  suite  executed  wrt  try  suite ?  ---> When  try  suite  does  not  raise  any  error
