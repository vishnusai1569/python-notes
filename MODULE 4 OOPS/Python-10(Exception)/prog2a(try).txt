try  suite
-----------
1) What  is  syntax  of  try  suite ?  --->  try:
                                                                      Risky  code

2) What  is  risky  code ? --->  That  code  where  there  is  a  possibility  of  error

3) What  is  the  advantage  of  try  suite ?  --->
							Error  raised  by  try  suite  can  be  caught  (or)  handled  with  except  suite

4) What  is  the  issue  with  statements  outside  try  suite ? --->
								Error  raised  by  those  statements  can  not  be  caught  (or)  handled

5) What  happens  when  error  is  not  caught ?  --->  Error  is  reported
												and
										     rest  of  the  program  is  skipped (abnormal  termination)

6) What  is  abnormal  termination ?  --->  Program  execution  stops  suddenly
										 and
								  rest  of  the  program  is  skipped

7) What  is  normal  termination ?   --->  Rest  of  the  program  is  executed  inspite  of  error

*8) try  suite  is  used  to  protect  from  errors  so  that  errors  are  not  reported

9) Can  try  suite  be  used  independently  without  except  suite  ?  --->  No

10) What  does  every  try  suite  demand  ?  --->  except  suite (or)  finally  suite  (or)  both

Note:
Do  not  enclose  whole  program  in  try  suite  instead  write  those  statements  in  try  suite  where
there  is  a   possibility  of  error

Eg: 10  statements
      try:
	     10  statements
      except:
	     some  code
      10  statements
