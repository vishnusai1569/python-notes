1) Can  try  suite  contain  another  try  suite  ?  --->  Yes  and  is  called  nested  try

2) Can  except  suite  contain  try  suite ? --->  Yes

3) Can  else  suite  contain  try  suite ?  ---> Yes

4) Can  finally  suite  contain  try  suite ?  --->  Yes

5) When  there  is  a  possibility  of  error  for  a  group  of  statements,  enlcose  them  in  try  suite

6) Similarly,  statements  of  except  suite  also  may  raise  an  error,   so  enclose  them  in  try  suite

7) Similarly,  statements  of  else  suite  may  raise  an  error,  so  enclose  them  in  try  suite

8) Similarly,  statements  of  finally  suite  may  raise  an  error,  so  enclose  them  in  try  suite
