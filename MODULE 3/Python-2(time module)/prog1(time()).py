4) a = time . time()  --->  Current  time  before  execution  of  100  statements
    100  statements
    b = time . time()  --->  Current  time   after  execution  of  100  statements

    What  is  b - a ?  --->  Execution  time  of  f1()  function

6) a = time . time()
    if stmt / match  stmt / for loop / while loop
    b = time . time()
    What  is  b - a ?  ---> Execution  time  of  if / match / for / while
