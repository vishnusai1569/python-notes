from  statement
--------------------
1) What  does  from  statement  do ?  --->  Imports  members  and  statements  of  the  module

2) What  is  not  imported ?  --->  Module

3) Are  methods  of  the  class  imported ?  --->
							No  becoz  they  are  members  of  the  class  but  not  members  of  the  module

4) What  is  the  pre-requisite  to  use  members  of  a  module ?  --->  They  need  to  be  improted

5) Can  members  of  a  module  be  used  without  importing  them ?  --->  No

6) What  is  the  difference  between  import  and  from  statements ? --->
									import  statement  imports  module  but  from  statement  imports
									members  of  the  module

7) How  to  import  single  member  of  the  module ?  --->  from  module  import  member
    How  to  import  multiple  members  of  the  module ?  --->from  module  import  member1 , member2 , member3
    How  to  import  all  the  members  of  the  module ?  ---> from  module  import  *

8) from  module  import  *
    What  does  *  indicate  ?  --->  All  the  members  of  module

9) How  to  access  members  of  the  module  after  they  are  imported ?  ---> Just  member  name  without  modulename  prefix

10) Can  from  statement  be  used  in  the  middle  of  the  program ?  --->  Yes

11) In  other  words,  members  can  be  imported  any  where  in  the  program  but  not  necessarily  at
     the  begining  of  the  program.

12) However  they  need  to  be  imported  before  their  usage

13) What  is  member  alias ? --->  Members  are  imported  with another  name

14) How  is  member  alias  achieved ?  --->  With  'as'  keyword

15) from  math  import  sqrt  as  s , pi  as  p
      What  does  the  above  statement  do ?  --->
						Imports  members  sqrt  and  pi  of  math  module  with  new  names  s  and  p  respectively
      How  to  call  sqrt()  function ?  --->  s(x)
      How  to  use  variable  pi ?  --->  Just  p

16) Can  old  names  be  used ?  --->  No  becoz  they  are  imported  with  another  name

17) from  module  import   Invalid-member
      What  does  the  above  statement  do ?  --->  Throws  ImportError

18) from  invalid-module  import  *
      What  does  the  above  statement  do ?  ---> Throws  ModuleNotFoundError

19) from  module1 , module2   import *
      Is  the  above  statement  valid ?  --->
					No  becoz  from  statement  can  import  members  of  single  module  but  not  multiple  modules

20) from  sys  as  s  import  *
      Is  the  above  statement  valid ?  --->
						No  becoz  moudle  alias  is  not  permitted  in  from  statement  as  module  is  not  imported

22) from   math  import   sqrt , pi , pow
      def   f1():
             from  math  import   gcd , factorial
      Who  can  use  members  gcd  and  factorial ?  --->  Just  f1()  function  becoz  they  are  imported  local  to  f1()  function
      Who  can  use  members  sqrt , pi   and  pow  ?  ---> Whole  program  becoz  they  are  imported  globally

23) from  math  import  *
      def   f1():
	   from  sys   import  *
      Can  *  be  used  locally ?  ---> No

24) In  other  words,  *  can  be  used  globally  but  not  locally
