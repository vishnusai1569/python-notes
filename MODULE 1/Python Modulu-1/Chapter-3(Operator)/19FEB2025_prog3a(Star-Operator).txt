*  operator
--------------
1) What  is  the  result  of  25 * 4 ?  ---> 100
    What  is  the  result  of  '25' * 4 ?  ---> '25252525'

2) What  does  non-seqeunce  *  non-sequence  do  ?  --->  Multiplication
     What  does  sequence *  integer   do  ? --->  Repeats  sequence  for  'n'  times
    
3) Is  *  operator  overloaded ? --->  Yes  becoz   *  operator  does  multiplication ,  repetition  and  unpacks  object

4) Is  sequence *  float  valid ?  --->  No  becoz  operand2  should  be  an  integer  when  operand1  is  a  sequence

5) Is  sequence * sequence  valid  ?  --->  No  becoz  sequences  can  not  be  multiplied  with  *  operator
