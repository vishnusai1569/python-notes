Membership    operators
------------------------------
1) What  are  the  two  membership  operators ?  --->  in  and  not  in

2) What  is  the  syntax  of  'in'  operator ?  --->  element  in  sequence

3) What  does  in  operator  do ? --->  Returns  True  when  element  is  in  the  sequence  and  False  otherwise

4) What  does  not  in  operator  do ? --->  Quite  opposite  to  in  operator
