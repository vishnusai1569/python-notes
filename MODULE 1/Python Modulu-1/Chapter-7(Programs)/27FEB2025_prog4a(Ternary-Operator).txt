Ternary  operator
---------------------
1) What  is  the  syntax  of  ternary  operator ?  --->   op1  if cond  else  op2

2) What  is  the  result  of  ternary  operator  when  cond  is  True ?  --->  op1
     What  is  the  result  of  ternary  operator  when  cond  is  False ?  ---> op2

3) In  other  words,  result  is  op1  (or)  op2  and  it  all  depends  on  the  condition

4) Why  is  it  called  ternary  operator ?  --->  Since  there  are  3  operands   
									   i.e.  op1  if  op3  else  op2

5) print(100  if  9 > 12  else  200)
    What  is  the  result  of  the  above  statement  ? --->  200  becoz  9 > 12  is  false

6) print('Hyd'  if  6 != 8  else  'Sec')
    What  is  the  result  of  the  above  statement ? --->  Hyd   becoz  6 != 8  is  true

7) op1  if  cond1  else  op2  if  cond2  else  op3
    When  is  the  result  op1 ?  --->  When  cond1  is  True
    When  is  the  result  op2 ?  --->  When  cond1  is  False  and  cond2  is  True
    When  is  the  result  op3 ?  --->  When  both  the  conditions  are  False

8) Ternary  operator  in  ternary  operator  is  called  nested  ternary  operator
