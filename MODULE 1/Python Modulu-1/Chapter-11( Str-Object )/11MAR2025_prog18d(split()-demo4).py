# Find  outputs  (Home  work)
a = 'Hyd	is	green	city' #  There  is  tab  between  the  words
print(a . split('\t'))  #  ['Hyd' , 'is' , 'green' , 'city']
print(a . split())  #  ['Hyd' , 'is' , 'green' , 'city']
print(a . split(' '))  #  ['Hyd\tis\tgreen\tcity']  becoz  there  are  no  spaces  in  the  string
