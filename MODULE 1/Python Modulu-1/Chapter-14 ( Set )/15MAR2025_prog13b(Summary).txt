What  are  the  four  methods  to  remove  set  element ?  --->   1) set . pop()
												     2) set . remove(x)												      												    
												     3) set . discard(x)												       												     
												     4) set . clear()

Note: 
1) Is  del  set[2]  valid ?  --->  No  becoz  set  is  not  indexed

2) Is  del  set  valid ?  --->  Yes  and  set  is  deleted
