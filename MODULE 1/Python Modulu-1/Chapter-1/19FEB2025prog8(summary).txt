Summary
-----------
1) How  many  objects  are  in  python ?  --->  5 + 6 = 11

2) How  many  objects  are  non-sequences  and  what  are  they ?  --->  5  i.e. int , float , complex , bool , NoneType
    How  many  objects  are  sequences  and  what  are  they ?  ---> 11 - 5 i.e. str , range , list , tuple , set  and  dict

3) What  is  a  sequence ?  ---> A  group  of  elements
    What  is  a  non-sequence ?  --->  A  single  element

4) Which  sequences  are  homogeneous  (Total : 2) ?  ---> str  and  range 
    Which  sequences  are  heterogeneous  (Total : 4) ?  --->  list , tuple , set  and  dict

5) Which  sequences  can  not  hold  duplicates (Total : 3) ?  ---> dict , set  and  range  

6) Which  sequences  are  not  indexed (Total : 2)  ?  --->  set  and  dictionary

7) Which  objects  are  mutable  (Total : 3) ?  ---> list , set  and   dict 
    Which  objects  are  immutable (Total: 5 + 3 = 8) ?  --->  int , float , complex , bool , NoneType , and tuple , str , range

8) Which  sequences  can  not  be  repeated (Total: 3) ?  ---> set , dict  and  range

9) Are  non-sequences  indexed ?  ---> No  due  to  single  element

10) Can  non-sequences  be  repeated ?  --->  No  becoz  *  operator  does  multiplication  but  not  repetition

11) What  is  the  argument  of  len()  function (sequence (or)  non-sequence) ?  --->  Sequence

12) Does  python  support  variables ?  --->  No  and  python  supports  only  objects
      
13) Is  python  100%  object  oriented  language (OOL) ?  --->  Yes  becoz  there  are  only  objects  but  not  variables and there  are  only  classes  but  not  datatypes
