Python
---------
Introduction
---------------
1) Python  is  a  general  purpose  high  level  programming  language

2) Machine  language (0's  and  1's)  and  Assembly  language (Pseudo  codes  like  8085 , 8086)
    are  lower  level  languages

3) C  and  C++  are  middle  level  languages

4) Java  and  Python  are  higher  level  languages

5) 'Guido  van  Rossam   has  designed  python  in  1989  but  released  in  the market  in  1991

6) Python  is  derived  from  'c'  and  ABC  languages

7) Pyhton  has  some  of  the  features  of  'c'  language  and  'ABC'  language

What  does  Python  support
----------------------------------
1) Python  is  a  functional  programming  language  (like  'C'  language)
    i.e. Python  supports  functions
    Eg:  def   f1():
                  statements
           def   f2():
                  statements
           def   f3():
		  statements

2) Python  is  an  Object  oriented  language (like  C++  and  Java)
    i.e. Python  supports  classes  and  objects
    Eg:  class   c1:
	           def   m1(self):
		           statements
	           def   m2(self):
		           statements
           # End  of  the  class
	   a = c1()  ---> 'a'  is  c1  class  object

3) Python  is  a  scripting  language (like  Perl  and  Shell  script)
    It  is  possible  to  write  a  python  program  without  using  functions  and  classes
    Eg:   stmt1
            stmt2
            stmt3
	    and  so  on

4) Python  is  a  modular  programming  language (like  Modula  3)

In  other  words,  pyhton  is  an  allrounder

Where  is  Python  used 
----------------------------
Python  can  be  used  to  design:
1) Desktop  applications (Stand  alone  applications ) like  Notepad , Calculator , Paint  Brush , ......

2) Web  applications

3) Database  applications  becoz  python  supports  PDBC(Python  Data  Base  Connectivity)

4) Networking  applications

5) Games

*6) Data  science  applications

*7) Machine  learning  applications

*8) Artificial  Intelligence

*9) IOT(Internet  Of  Things) applictions


Features  of  Python
-------------------------
1) Simple  and  Easy  to  learn

2) Free  Ware(i.e. Free  of  cost) and 
    Open  Source(i.e. We  can  see  source  code  behind  Python  and  modify  it)

3) High  Level  programming  language

4) Platform  independent  language (like Java)
    i.e. Compile  anywhere ('X'  O.S.  and  'Y'  Processor) and  run  any  where  else
    This  is  in  contrast  to  C  and  C++  where  program  must  be  executed  on  the  same  system  
    where  it  is  compiled

5) Portability
    i.e. Migrate  from  one  system  to  another  system  without  making  any  major  changes

*6) Dynamically  typed  language
      i.e. Objects  can  be  used  without  any  prior  declaration
      Eg:  x = 25  --->  since  25  is  int,  'x'   is  automatically  int (Don't  write   int   x)
             print(type(x)) --->  <class  'int'>

7) Procedure  oriented  and  object  oriented (like  C++)
    i.e. Python  program  can  be  designed  with  and  without  class (like  C++)
    Java  program  must  contain  class  but  it  is  not  mandatory  in  Python

8) Interpreter  language
    i.e.  Line  by  line  translation  and  execution
    stmt1  --->  Translated  and  executed
    stmt2  --->  Translated  and  executed
    stmt3  --->  Translated  and  executed
      .....
    Translation  and  Execution  are  alternate
    (C  and  C++  are  compiler  languages,
    Python  is  interpreter  language  and
    Java  is  both  compiler  and  interpreter  language)

9) Extensible
    i.e. Pyhton  program  can  use  other  language  functions  and  methods  and  
    thereby  performance  of  the  application  is  improved

10) Embedded
      i.e.  Python  code  can  be  used  in  other  language  programs

11) In  other  words,  extensible  and  embedded  are  quite  opposite

12) Extensive  library
      There  are  too  many  libraries(predefined  functions  and  classes)  in  python


Limitations
-------------
1) Performance  of  python  program  is  low  becoz  python  is  an  interpreter  language
    i.e. Python  program  is  translated  every  time  program  is executed
    Therefore  Python  program  execution  is  slow  due  to  repeated  translation
    This  is  in  contrast  to  C  and  C++  where  program  execution  is  fast  becoz  they  are  compiler  languages

2) Python  is  not  suitable  for  mobile  applications

Different  Flavors  of  Python
-----------------------------------
Since  Python  is  open  source, There  are  several  flavors  of  python
1) Cpython(Original  Python)

2) Jython  (or) JPython

3) IronPython

4) PyPy

5) RubyPython

6) Anaconda  Python

7) Stackless
