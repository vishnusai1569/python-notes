Suite  (or)  Block
--------------------
1) What  is  a  suite ? --->  A  group  of  statement
       Eg:   stmt1					      	 
             stmt2
             stmt3
                    ....

2) What  is  indentation ? --->  Statements  of  the  suite  should  be  in  the  same  column  there  should  not  be  spacebar  (or)  tab  key  before  the  statement

3) In  other  words,  every  suite  should  be  indented

4) Invalid:  stmt1
	                 stmt2
	                       stmt3

5) {
         stmt1
         stmt2
         stmt3
    }
    Can  suite  be  in  braces ?  ---> No

6) In  other  words,  braces  can  be  used  for  set  and  dictionary  but  not  for  suite
