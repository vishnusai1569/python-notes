Points  to  remember
------------------------
1) Does  python  have  main()  function ?  --->  No

2) int   a;
    float   b;
    Are  the  above  statements  valid ?  --->  No  becoz  there  are  no  declarations  in  python

3) In  other  words,  object  can  be  used  directly  without  any  prior  declaration

4) a = 25
    What  is  the  type(a) ?  ---> int  becoz   25  is  an  integer  number

5) b = 10.8
    What  is  the  type(b) ?  ---> float  becoz  10.8  is  a  float  number

6) Therefore  python  is  called  a  dynamically  typed  language

7) Are  there  values  in  python  ?  --->  No  
    What  is  25  called  in  python  ?  ---> An  int   class  object  
    What  is  10.8  called  in  python  ?  --->  A  float  class  object 
    What  is  True  called  in  python  ?  ---> A  bool  class  object 

8) Everything  is  an  object  in  python  

9) What  are  int , float , bool , complex  called  (classes  (or)  datatypes) ?  --->  classes  but  not  datatypes

10) Is  ;  mandatory  at  the  end  of  statements ?  --->  No  and  it  is  optional

11) Is  python  a  100%  OOL (object  oriented  language) ?  --->  Yes  becoz  there  are  only  classes  but  not  datatypes and also 
    there  are  only  objects   but  not  variables

12) Is  python  a  compiler  language  (or)  interpreter  language  ?  --->  An  interpreter  language

13) What  is  an  interpreter  language ?  --->  Line  by  line  translation  and  execution

14) In  other  words,  translation  and  execution  are  alternate

15) Python  program  is  executed  at  the  time  of  translation  itself

16) Is  python  program  execution  fast  (or)  slow ?  --->  Slow  due  to  repeated  translation

17) In  other  words,  python  program  is  translated  every  time  program  is  executed.
