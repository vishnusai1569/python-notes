for  each  loop
-----------------
1) What  is  the  advantage  of  for  ...  each  loop ?  --->  Simple  in  syntax  and  easy  to  understand
                                                                                          Eg:  for  x   in  sequence:
                                                                                                              statements

2) What  are  the  five  dis-advantages  of  for  ...  each  loop ?  --->                          
     a) It  can  track  elements  of  sequence  but  not  their  indexes          
     b) It  can  not  iterate  sequence  in  reverse  order                              
     c) It  can  iterate  only  one  sequence  at  a  time  but  not  multiple  sequences  simultaneously                    
         Eg:  for   x , y  in   seq1 , seq2:
                             pass    
    d) It  can  not  iterate  a  part  of  the  sequence                             
    e) It  can  not  modify  elements  of  sequence

3) Which  is  a  better  for  loop ? --->  Indexed  based  for  loop  is  more  powerful  when  compared  to  for ... each  loop


Note:
1) First  option   --->  for ... each  loop 

2) 2nd  option  ---> Indexed  based  for  loop  when   it  is  not  possible  to  use  for  each  loop
