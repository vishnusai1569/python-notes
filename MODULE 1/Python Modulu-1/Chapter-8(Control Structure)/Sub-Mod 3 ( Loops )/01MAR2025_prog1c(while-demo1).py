Infinite  Loop
-----------------
1) What  is  infinite  loop ?  --->  When  loop  condition  is  always  true,  it  is  called  infinite

2) How  many  times  are  statements  inside  infinite  loop  executed ?  ---> Infinite  times

3) What  about  statements  outside  the  loop ?  --->  They  are  never  executed

4) Is  infinite  loop  recommended ?  --->  No  and  it  should  be  avoided

5) Finally, ensure  that  loop  condition  becomes  false,  at  least  after  few  iterations
     (if  not  immediately)
