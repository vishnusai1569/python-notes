--------------
while   cond:
	statements
	if  cond:
	       break
        statements
else: 
        statements
#End of  while  loop
statements

1) When  is  else  suite  executed  ?  ---> Soon  after  termination  of  while  loop  provided  loop  is  not  broken

2) When  is  else  suite  skipped  ? --->  If  the  loop  is  broken

3) How  many  times  statements  of  else  suite  executed ?  --->  Just  once  becoz  it  is  outside  the  loop


Note:
while   cond:
	stmt1
	if  cond:
		stmt2
	else:  --->  corresponds  to  if  becoz  it  is  indented with  if
		stmt3
else:  --->   corresponds  to  while  becoz  it  is  indented with   while
	stmt4
