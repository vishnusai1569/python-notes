for ... else
------------
for  x  in  sequence:
	statements
	if  cond:
                 break
        statements
else: 
	statements
#End of  for  loop
statements

1) When  is  else  suite  executed  ?  --->  After  termination  of  for  loop  provided  loop  is  not  broken

2) When  is  else  suite  skipped  ? --->  If  the  loop  is  broken  in  the  middle

3) for  x  in  sequence:
		stmt1
		if  cond:
		     break
	        stmt2
    else: 
		stmt3
    #End of  for  loop
    stmt4
    How  many  times  are  stmt3  and  stmt4  executed ?  --->  Only  once  becoz  they  are  outside  the  loop
    What  is  the  difference  between  stmt3  and  stmt4 ?  --->         										
										stmt4  is  always  executed  irrespective  of  loop  is  broken  or  not
								                but  stmt3  is  executed  only  when  loop  is  not  broken

4) for  x  in  sequence:
	   statements
	   if  cond:
		   break
	   else: 
                  statements
   Does  else  correspond  to  for  loop  (or)  if ?  --->  If  becoz  it  is  indented  with  if

Note: No  other  language  permits  else  with  'for'  loop  except  python
