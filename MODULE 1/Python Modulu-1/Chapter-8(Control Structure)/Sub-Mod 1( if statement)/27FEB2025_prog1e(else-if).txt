Dis-advantage  of  else  and  if
-----------------------------------
if  cond1:
	stmt1
	stmt2
	stmt3
else:
	if   cond2:
		stmt4
		stmt5
		stmt6
	else:
		if   cond3:
			stmt7
			stmt8
			stmt9
		else:
			stmt10
			stmt11
			stmt12
stmt13

What  is  the  issue  when  else  and  if  are  used  separately  instead  of  elif ?  ---> 												
									No  readability  and  clarity  due  to  too  many  indentations
