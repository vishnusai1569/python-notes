# Identify  error
if  ():
			print('Hyd')
	else:  #   Error  becoz  else  is not  indented  with  if
					print('Sec')
print('Bye')



'''
1) What  is  another  rule  for  else ?  --->  It  should  be  indented  with  if

2) if   condition:
	       stmt1
           stmt2
           stmt3
    else:
					stmt4
                    stmt5
                    stmt6
   Is  the  above  if  valid ?  --->  Yes  becoz  statements  of  if  suite  and  else  suite  need  not  be  indented
